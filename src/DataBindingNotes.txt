DataBinding::
=============
->  DataBinding in Angular Allows us to Communicate between 
    a Component class and its Corresponding viewTemplate & Vice-versa.

    Component [ UI Logic ]    Communication between Component & viewTemplate     ViewTemplate [ HTML ]
                            <-----------------------------------------------> 


DataBinding Can be done by
   -> Component class to ViewTemplate 
   -> viewTemplate to ComponentClass
   -> Both Ways.


DataBinding is Divided into Two Different Types

1.  OneWay DataBinding
    ==================
    OneWay DataBinding is When,data can be access from ComponentClass to Corresponding ViewTemplate or Vice-Versa.
    Note:  Only one way is possible.

    we can divide OneWay DataBinding into two different types.

    1. ComponentClass to viewTemplate 
       -> Data is passed from ComponentClass to viewTemplate.

          Can be Achieved in Two Ways.
          1. "STRING INTERPOLATION"   {{data}}
          2. "PROPERTY BINDING"       [property] = data

    2. ViewTemplate to ComponentClass
       -> Data is passed from viewTemplate to ComponentClass.

          Can be Achieved in Below way
          1. "EVENT BINDING"         (data) = "expresssion"

          

2.  TwoWay DataBinding
    ==================

    1. Data Flows in Both the Direction in the same Time.
    2. If we change someThing in ComponentClass, That will reflect in ViewTemplate
       If we change someThing in ViewTemplate, That will reflect in ComponentClass

    3. we use [(ngModel)] to Achieve this.











"STRING INTERPOLATION"  {{ }}
======================

1. OneWay Databinding . Data Flows From ComponentClass to viewTemplate.
2. Use Property Name / TS expression / Function Call  inside the double curly bases {{}}
3. We can use Ternary Operator also in Stirng Interpolation



"PROPERTY BINDING" []
=====================

1. OneWay DataBinding. Data Flows From ComponentClass to ViewTemplate.




Q.>  "STRING INTERPOLATION" And "PROPERTY BINDING" Both are OneWay DataBinding Types [ ComponentClass to ViewTemplate ]
      What is the difference between them???

A.>  "STRING INTERPOLATION" is used to just display a piece of data in the HTML, Such as Title / Name.
  
     "PROPERTY BINDING" to bind the "property of a DOM object" to "Some Value,which we have in Component Class" 
     "PROPERTY BINDING" allows us to show/hide a DOM Element  "OR" to Manipulate the DOM in another way.


     Note:: For Html Properties like "Disabled / Hidden / Checked"  STRING INTERPOLATION will not work
            Need to use PROPERTY BINDING

     When There is need to display the Value -> "STRING INTERPOLATION"
     When There is need to Assign dynamicValue to HTML Attribbute -> "PROPERTY BINDING"
